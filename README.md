# DeepSearch
DeepSearch is a lightweight, interactive file search tool for Windows that helps you quickly locate files by keyword across any folder and its subdirectories.

Core Functionality
1. Native Folder Selection: Uses Windows' built-in folder picker dialog for intuitive path selection (Downloads, Desktop, Documents, etc.)

2. Keyword-based Recursive Search: Scans entire directory trees to find files matching your search term, stores all matching file information with full paths

3. Interactive Results Display: Shows numbered results with file names and sizes using custom display formatting

4. Precise File Access: Select any result by serial number to get the complete file path instantly

5. Looping Workflow: Search repeatedly until you type '404' to exit

# User Workflow
1. Select folder via native dialog
2. Enter search keyword (e.g., "pdf", "report", "invoice")
3. Confirm path (Y/N)
4. Specify max results count
5. View results table → Pick serial number
6. Get full file path → Continue or exit

DeepSearch eliminates manual folder browsing by combining Windows-native UI with powerful recursive search, delivering exact file paths in seconds. Perfect for students, developers, and power users who need fast file location without complex setup
